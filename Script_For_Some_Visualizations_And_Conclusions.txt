Bar Chart

On the left is a bar chart of numbers of predictions of hate speech on a sample of 1000 testing observations.
A version of TinyBERT that was trained on HateSpeechDataset*Balanced* predicted that many texts were hate speech.
I, and BERT and TinyBERT trained on HateSpeechDataset, predicted that similar numbers of texts were hate speech.
A version of DistilBERT that was trained on ETHOS, Lorinda, and Hannah predicted that similar numbers of texts were hate speech.


Agreements Matrix

On the right is an agreements matrix.

TinyBERT agreed most with BERT and less with DistilBERT. TinyBERT agreed most with Tom.
BERT agreed most with TinyBERT and less with DistilBERT. BERT agreed most with Tom.
DistilBERT agreed most with TinyBERT and less with BERT. DistilBERT agreed most with Tom and Lorinda.

To introduce a little levity, perhaps Tom thinks most like a computer.
To go a little deeper with that thought, maybe BERT was designed to think like Google engineers.


Network Diagram

Here are network diagrams.
Lorinda and Tom's ground-truth labeling of test data was most similar.
Hannah's labeling was pretty similar to Lorinda and Tom's labeling.
ETHOS / DistilBERT labeling was fairly similar to human labeling, following by HateSpeechDataset / BERT, followed by TinyBERT.


Conclusions

I recommend the following.

Be careful with resources
- Human resources: I'm about to go on a company retreat. I recommend building trust throughout projects​ and being intentional about communication.
- I work as a software developer and am learning GIS. I recommend distributing work according to skills, then interests​.
- Management resources: Come up with a Software Development Plan, a System Development Plan, a Deployment Plan, and a Kanban board.
- Development resources: Come up with a System Description, a System Diagram, Use-Case Descriptions, user stories, an Interface Design, and prototypes.
- Operating system resources: Minimize number of checkpoints and libraries​.
- Application resources: Use Git.
- Transition away from Jupyter notebooks​.
- Use PyTorch instead of TensorFlow​.
- Use GPU's​.
- Use multiple Virtual Machines.

Improve performance
- Modify architecture or tune​
- Maybe train, validate, and test on larger texts​
- Maybe Use an ensemble

We did not discover a clear impact of policy change on hate speech.
Hate speech can be difficult to identify.
Our models were able to identify clear cut hate speech.
We shared a paper and code​ with the public.

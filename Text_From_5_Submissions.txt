Not the way that works. The payment was reduced to $747 million before taxes by taking the cash option.
----- End Comment -----

Commonly known that taking the "lump sum" option (over the annuity for 30yrs or however long) cuts a jackpot in half, so 0.64 Billion, or 640mil.

433.7mil / 640.0 = 67.77%

Meaning, roughly 32.2% of the 640mil taken as taxes. This checks out.

Had the winner taken the 1.28bil over 30 years, they would be getting roughly 3.56mil *per month*, and would see the same amount of taxes being taken (highest tax bracket), reducing total "take-home" winnings to 868mil over 30 years.

If you can trust yourself to be responsible with the money, lump sum is smarter because you can invest it - highly diversified - and WAY MORE than double the money in those 30 years. If you are bad with money, take the annuity and have fun living on your 2.XXmil-per-month allowance that even the hottest sugar-babies would envy.

If that's a one-time payment, the tax men did NOT garner that much in taxes. Do the single check, it's MUCH LOWER than the win!!!

Aside from the fact that the winner gets a ton of money (which is a huge positive to start with) it’s always best to take the lump sum and invest over 30 years (vs taking payments over 30 years)…right? That’s what I’ve heard. Haven’t done the math.

But Mr. Woodpecker deliberately fails to mention that the cash option chosen by the winner pays out HALF OF THE JACKPOT AMOUNT, or $640 million, NOT $1.28 billion. The the state of Ohio gets its cut in state income tax along with IRS.

It’s not all taxes. The winner probably took cash option which leaves them with a little over half of the total amount and then 36% of that is federally taxed.

Umm actually with a lump sum payout the lottery company keeps about half then you are taxed on the rest as income tax,37% on everything over half a million. And depending on which state you won possible state taxes on top of that. But anything over 10ish million and you are set for life, as long as you can keep quiet and don’t tell a soul you won.

Lumpsum is definitely better as you have to consider the opportunity cost. So if you get it installments, you loose out on opportunity to invest the money. The same justification for interests on loans, its the loss opportunities you would have been able to do with the money while it was lent.

That's not how lottery winnings work.

That drawing, which was the Mega Millions drawing on July 29th, 2022, was actually $1.337 billion (Forbes was wrong on that, and their article is still wrong today). That is the annuity amount, as in you get $1.337 billion spread out over 20 years. The cash prize, which is what Mega Millions has on hand to give you immediately, was $780.5 million.

1 - ($433.7 million / $780.5 million) = 44.43% total tax (assuming the take-home was 433.7, which I doubt)

The government got $346.8 million, not 846.3.

The real facepalm is the idiocy of people believing that the IRS gets the difference between the “prize” and the “actual payout”.

Fir starters, no one ever wins the prize.  If you’d bothered to read the lottery tickets, you’d already see that a lump sum winner only gets about 50%, while an annuity winner only gets about 45ish%, where that amount is then split into annuities so that those annuities gain interest which grows into the stated “prize”.  Then the minimum jackpot gets take out, and the rest goes to the US budget (NOT the IRS) as a line item for “education” (although it doesn’t necessarily get spent on that).

From there, THEN the IRS gets their cut.

I always wondered why someone wouldn't take the lump sum, but I heard an explanation that makes some sense to me.  A lot of new lottery winners don't know how to manage such large amounts of money and a lump sum just gives them more to blow, but a yearly payment gives them a second chance if their first year as a millionaire ends with them having blown through a lot of the first payment.

As others have said, the $1.28 billion was if you take the money over time. The one time cash payment was $747.2 million. The resulting figure is in line with state and federal income tax.

Didn’t people want to make a country where the government won’t tax them for freaking everything  and for a government that will let them do what they want? My current favorite saying is “Every hero who lives becomes their worst villain” only a hero who doesn’t want anything and will never change their beliefs will stay. Think about it. A homeless person if they become a billionaire will lose all interest in helping the others in their previous situation because they know they got out of it without help so think they can too.

One thing to know is that as the interest rate RISES, the lump sum payout goes DOWN. It reflects that less money now at a higher interest rate is needed to meet the series of payments, should the winner choose it. 

 Asked from memory, a winners situation will depend on legally who wins it and owns it. If only one person signs the ticket, only they get paid. If they die before the last payment, the inheritance tax is owed upon the entire remaining PAYMENTS, not the lump sum at that point in time. This is why payment recipients need BIG life insurance to pay the taxes. The alternative is the annuity payments must be sold for a lump sum to pay taxes now, and you’ll get screwed there. Couldn’t believe it when I read it a long time ago but it was clear. I hope they have changed it

In my country you pay the lottery tax when you buy the ticket, not when you win.  

Means the money isn't tied up for ages with casino companies.  

And also feels less like a fuck you to the winner because it's already taxed.

They can have those taxes.  I'm 100% fine with whatever lump sum I get because it's gonna be at least TRIPLE what I paid for the ticket.  And that's a pretty good payout.

The irs isn’t getting that much either.  The big payout amount is based on taking the annuity which is a higher amount than the lump sum due to high interest rates now.  Take the lump sum and they actually get less, these calculations are always wrong and based on the lump sum amount at the annuity amount nobody gets.

Its crazy how much Americans get taxed, and not only on the lotto (lotto wins are tax free in my country). I'm in an EU country and always her from Americans how I pay more in taxes but I recently saw an American break down how much the pay in taxes, healthcare then State taxes and they were higher than what people on the same payscale pay in my country.

And then theres the price of goods, easily at least twice what I pay for the exact same product.

I'll call BS to this. 

If the winner took the lump sum, his/her winnings were only about 50% of $1.28B. So, they only received around $6 million. After all the taxes are added Uncle Sam (IRS) gets around 38% of the winnings, so $434 million would be about right.

I hope I win the dam lottery because I'll file an injunction against the government because 1) I didn't risk the bet to buy the ticket to share with them.  2) they must pay me what the lottery publicizes I won, not what they steal from you after you win BEFORE they even pay you. then tell you what you won.  
3) even if you must pay this bullshit tax, they should not tax you until tax season after you file taxes, you should be allowed to have all the money until tax time.   technically , they owe you interest on 1.6billion until taxes are due so total BS there too!
why not just take the $ out of the lottery BEFORE anyone wins and give the winner the amount of money they really won?  
that would be more fair to Rob the state lottery fund before anyone wins it.
I think there should be a bill to pay unearned income without taxation.  
$400million is only 1/4 what you won.

Because that's not enough money to live comfortably for the rest of your life or anything as long as you're not a freaking moron.

I mean, that’s sorta why the lottery exists at all. Government allows it to get some tax money back from welfare programs. If they couldn’t tax it, they wouldn’t allow it. 

That $433m is the number from the lump sum immediate payout, which is $742m, which then gets taxes taken from it.

I’ve seen this posted numerous times and it’s always a misunderstanding of how the lottery actually works.  When you get a jackpot you get an option a) The jackpot paid out in monthly installments over decades b) Lump-sum payment

The jackpot is quoted based on the total of (a) but if you choose (b) you get a significant decrease

Also the whole point of a state lottery is to raise tax revenue anyway.

Does it really make a difference though? I mean as much as taxes suck the lottery is probably the most fair version. That is you don’t slave away at a job somewhere and they just take money out of your check every payday. To take it a step further, even if they take that much money out of your winnings but that money almost never existed anyway, if you get my drift so you still made over $400 million in your pocket from spending, however much you spent on those lotto Tickets, so at the end of the day you’re still set for life and will never have to work again when you win that insane amount of money in your pocket even after it’s all set and done

I don’t think the IRS got that much. They probably took the cash option and then state and federal taxes came out but No matter the state the total of both taxes would not equate to 800+ million dollars. Person probably paid exactly what the tax rate is for that amount of money.

The other day I was thinking about taxes and realized that every product gets taxed multiple times. Let’s say you buy fish. You paid sales tax. The store you bought it from paid sales tax when they purchased the fish from a distributor. A distributor paid tax when they bought it from a fisherman. A fisherman that sold it to a distributor, paid income tax. And the distributor that sold it to a store paid income tax on that sale. And the store paid income tax on that sale. You paid income tax on the money you bought that fish with. Now the fisherman paid for a commercial fishing license. He also paid his employees that caught the fish you bough. Those employees were paid with the fisherman’s profit from selling fish. Profit that was taxed. They too pay income tax and they too pay sales tax when they buy the fish from the store. It’s fucking bonkers. Maybe I’m just stoned.

This is the perfect example of how people believe things they see on social media. Yes, the IRS gets a lot, but not as much as the OP states. Lump payment is about half the advertised amount, so really $600k payout, not $1.2B. Then that $600k is taxes.

Ironically good. We don't need more billionaires in the world (or millionaires, for that matter) and the entire lottery system wouldn't exist in a civilized society. 99.9% of people who buy lotto tickets are wasting their money. Some states use the lottery to "Fund" the education system, but only a fraction of that money (approx. 30% in my state) actually goes to fund public schools.

Even if this wasnt completely ignoring the way the lump sum payment works, both amounts are, for the average person, functionally identical.  It is more money than you know what to do with or could ever realistically spend if you just pay a little bit of attention. That is life changing money, and not all in a good way.  Big winners are the targets of high end scams, cons, blackmail, extortion, ransom, straight up robbery, etc.  'Family' you never knew you had appear out of nowhere.  Friendships become problematic as the newly wealthy person starts to doubt the motives of everyone around them, and unfortunately that doubt is very often justified.  People who say money cant buy happiness are deluded, but there is also a point at which you have too much and can no longer really relate to anyone but the crazy wealthy anymore, and even then they are competition.  The stupidly rich have a version of happiness in that they can have anything you can buy with money, but I am not sure it is enough to compensate for the bullshit that comes with being newly rich.  Particularly for people who had very little before.  It's like blood in the water since people know they dont have a clue how to handle or secure that kind of wealth or what they can and cant do because of it.

The 30yr option is the right way to go.

1) you have an annual safety net under you. Most people who take the lump sum blow it, & wind up worse off than before they won.

3) the choice is: Big fun now with no safety net, or little fun & security for the rest of your life.

Okay, I hate paying taxes as much as the next guy, but the only reason the taxes are this high is because the person decided to take the "lump sum" route rather than the "long-term annuity" route.

Sure, you still have to pay taxes, but if you do long-term annuity, the tax laws could change for the better. And, also, it gives you the chance to invest enough to pay back the raxes while still living comfortably. 

You just have to be smart about how you do it. No one wants a couple million a year for the rest of their lives, they wanna burn through the "entire amount" immediately. Thus is the price or instant gratification.

--->You also need to be able to find an accountant/broker you can trust (difficult if you have no experience doing so), and you need to be in a position where having all the money at once isn't a risk. If you're married, you could lose a LOT of that money to a divorce, whereas if it's coming in monthly, you can build back up no matter what. 

I had a family friend who was rich enough to donate buildings to schools, but she was a SAHM with a super rich husband. Husband died unexpectedly, and she got paranoid and pushed all her friends away - most of whom were also wealthy, and had no designs on her fortune. Well, her broker was terrible and she had 0 investing/money literacy, and she lost everything over the course of the next 10 years. Ended up losing her mansion and moving in with one of the kids she had pushed away in her paranoia. 

Even if you don't spend your money irresponsibly, you can lose it all by trusting the wrong person and not knowing enough to vet them. Having a monthly stipend means you have more time and chances to find trustworthy people, and less to lose all at once to scammers and sharks. 

Plus that much money is more than enough to live the rest of your life luxuriously. You literally don't have to grow it at all. You could spend 200K a month and dump the rest into a shitty savings account and you'd still die rich. Obviously you should make it grow and work for you, but your first absolute priority should be to protect yourself from losing your fortune. Once you're protected, THEN you can grow it. Taking a lump just makes you such a target to everyone in your life trying to grift it off you.

--->I did the math for the current Powerball. Your hurdle rate to be ambivalent about lump vs annuity (given static taxes) is around 4.4% after taxes on those gains, so you need to earn about a 7% rate which isn't easy to do, but US equities have averaged over that for a while. Past performance is no guarantee of future results ;).

--->Yeah, this is exactly it. These memes on these lottery payouts are accurate, but very, very misleading. You only get the full 1.2 billion if you take the annuity. The upfront cash payment is about 50% of that, minus maybe 30% in Federal taxes. The IRS did not rake in $800 million in "profit" off this lottery ticket.

If you are the type to properly invest and spend responsibly then the lump sum is better.  
If you are the tragically common lotto winner then taking it in installments can help ensure that your money will last 30 years instead of just 3.  

Also, the headline is bait.  $1.28 billion is the 30 year payout while the $433.7 million after tax is for the lump sum which is only $747.2 million.

They already have a generally poor understanding of taxes and a negative opinion of the IRS. Throwing a huge number at them like 800 million is enough to trigger a rage impulse even though 1) It's wrong, and 2) your average person can't even fathom the spending power of 400 million.

Say you are taxed on roulette winnings. You bet on red vs black. The odds are 1/1 (excluding the green) but if you need to pay x amount of tax the odds suddenly change dramatically. You bet £10 you only receive say £8 in winnings so it's no longer 1/1. It completely changes the dynamic of the game.

Like, if you hit a jackpot in your 20s, you can reasonably expect to get the full amount of payments, and it "stops" you from being an idiot with the money. But if you hit a jackpot in your 50s or 60s, it's likely better to take the lumpsum.

You get constant money so you can’t really ever blow it all. Still plenty to invest and assuming money always increases in value over time when invested is silly (unless you do CD)

Invest in something simple like SPY.  How many years did it take to double your money?  15 years?

> Consider if an investor put their money in the S&P 500. Historically, it has averaged 11.5% returns between 1928 and 2022. In 6.4 years, their money would double, assuming these average returns.

So even 10 years, the money probably doubles.  Another 10 doubled again.

I looked it up just so people understand: the current Powerball jackpot is $685,000,000. That’s the advertised annuity over 29 years. The cash is what’s used to fund the annuity, and that is $344,700,000. Ok still a massive chunk of change, but the cash amount you receive after taxes is $217,161,000.

So yes, exactly. “Congratulations to the IRS for their $300,000,000 winnings” is perfectly accurate for the post, and it’s a point well taken.

Annuity guarantees your income for 30 years. And with a jackpot this size (1.28B), even in the first year you'd be cut a check for $19 million. In year 10? $29 million. That's generational wealth where you could live an extremely lavish lifestyle and still put away 50% of it into investments.

--->--->--->The close-enough math for a lottery is 1% a year in interest after taxes from the advertised jackpot: 1.28 billion is ~12.8 million a year in interest

More precise math:

1.28 ~50% lump sum = 614 million

Keep 67% after federal tax = 411 million

Invest 411 million at 5% (you can get 5% in a CD or high yield savings, its guaranteed). = **20.5 million in interest**

Keep 67% for capital gains: **13.76 million** after taxes

Your idea is correct and I'm just being pedantic because I like describing how much money the capitalist class generates for doing literally nothing, and how insane it is that individual humans have >1 billion dollars.

Anyway, the highest high yield savings accounts I could find in a quick Google search was 4.6% APY. 1% APY on 350 million is 3.5 million/yr or ~300k/month. 4.6% of 350 million is >16 million/yr or >1 million/month.

Yes it is said you are guaranteed the money, but if they go bankrupt.  That guarantee goes away.  

If you take the lump sum and invest it yourself.  Like the insurance company will do.  As they will take your massive cash and basically gamble with it.  Even though they are not supposed to.

--->--->--->If you die the lottery annuity payments become part of your estate. Your family doesn’t lose the money. 

No, the reason is that when taking the lump sum and investing it you would always end up with more money after 30 years the taking the annuity payments.

For example, assuming an annuity setup of 30 equal yearly payments and 8% average annual stock market returns, you’d end up with 30% more by just taking the lump sum and investing it. 

And that’s if the annuity payments are equal. Many are actually back-loaded. Powerball pays a (relatively) small amount up front, and then the annual payment increases 5% each year.  So you’d be way better off taking the lump sum there.

--->--->--->Would you rather have $500,000 now or $50,000 a year for 20 years, or $1,000,000 in 20 years? 

Usually, it is better to take the $500,000 now, because you can invest the $500,000 now, and if you can get a 5% gain per year, you will have $1,320,000 in 20 years. 

If you use the average return of 10% that the SP500 has returned over the last 50 years, you would have $3,360,000 dollars if you take the $500,000 now.

The bottom line is that one dollar now is better than 2 dollars in 20 years.

For instance, in the scenario above. Say the guy took the $433.7M and put $300M in an investment portfolio while he lived off the $133.7M. The $300M at 5% compounded annually would turn into close to $1.3B after 30 years. That’s the length of the annuity.

I am over 50 so if I were to win something like that I would take the lump sum because who knows if I will live another 30 years? If I was 20 I might take the annuity.

The winner quite literally did not work for that money. They didn't "start their own business." They didn't "innovate" anything.
 
The lowest of the lowest crack head could have stumbled into a gas station, mumbled something about powerball through his dried up cotton mouth, handed over $3, and then became a billionaire that same night while he was smoking his third 8-ball of the day.

If your winnings are taxed then it changes the outcome of the game.

You bet £100 on red. You walk out the casino with £200 in your pocket if you win. If your winnings are taxed at say 20% then you leave with £180 (assuming it's just your winnings that are taxed excluding stake money). It's no longer 1/1

The odds reflect the risk. It's for all intents and purposes a 50/50 chance of red and black (with a small chance of hitting green) so the risk vs reward matches the odds. I risk £1 to win £1. Why would I risk £1 to win £0.80 when the odds are near enough 50:50. The risk doesn't match the reward now. I'm not getting a 1/1 return on a bet with 1/1 odds because the prize money is taxed.

Not sure trusting an accountant with access to all of your money if you win a jackpot is a good idea anyway. With common sense, that money could be managed by a reasonable person.

What I can say, you go to a casino and win $1,500.00 on a slot machine; the casino will likely take your information including your social security number and issue you a W2-G. This income will be reported to the IRS, you fail to claim that as income, well your chances of getting an audit increase dramatically.


Now, if you go to a casino and win $500.00. This will not be reported anywhere and it is up to the winner to report all income on their taxes.


And yes, the winner could donate or have other tax deduction(s) that would lower their taxable income to offset a portion of said winnings.

As for sports betting apps, they could be keeping an annual total of winnings for a customer and report that to the IRS and the customer. 

But with lottery, I am confident the state is inland aware of much they should get and that will all be decided before the winner is paid

Taking this case into consideration: if you invest 700m immediately, 30 years later you will have 5.6b (700m * 2^3 = 5.6b). almost 4 billion more than if you take the annuity.

No, smart winners, the first thing they do is hire a lawyer and an accountant,  and form a corporation and/or trust to collect the prize and keep their names out of it. Then you keep your mouth shut. If you -want- to give some of the money away, you have your accountant write a check and send it.

At current high yield savings account rates, accepting a lump sum, spending $1 mil per year, and shoving the rest in a savings account would result in you having more money at the end than if you had taking the payment plan, shoved it all in a checking account as it arrived, and never spent a dime.

To make more than a high-yield savings account, you don't have to play the market in some clever way, you can just shove the money in index funds at any time besides the peak of a bubble economy. You could spend 10 mil per year and still end up with way, WAY more than you started with.

You could literally just leave all of the money in a bank account and live as you did before and have millions left over without ever fucking around with stocks or mutual funds or other shit, but people that win the lottery don't understand the difference between big numbers and infinity. They can't perceive the difference between 100 million and 1 billion, its all just "a shit ton of money, more than I could ever run out of" until they run out of it.

That's why I'd just take the annual 30 year payment. It's something like $30 mil per year. I think I *just maybe* could live pretty comfortably with that. And there's literally *zero* chance that I could blow it all in a few years.

A Powerball jackpot winner may choose to the receive their prize in 30 annual payments or a one-time, lump-sum cash payment. The cash value option, in general, is the amount of money required to be in the jackpot prize pool, on the day of the drawing, to fund the estimated jackpot annuity prize. The advertised jackpot annuity and cash value are estimates until ticket sales are final, and for the annuity, until the Multi-State Lottery Association takes bids on the purchase of securities. Federal and jurisdictional income taxes apply to both jackpot prize options. Check with your lottery for its rules on how to claim a jackpot prize and the correct procedure for selecting the annuity or cash value option.

The market will *always* be fluctuating. It trends upwards, but there's no way to predict another GFC or market trends. 

Like, right now investing (in stocks) is a terrible idea compared to following bank interest rates and throwing liquid cash into the high yield bank accounts that exist around the world for the first time in decades, because the interest rates ensure they have a higher average return than the stock market can currently provide. This situation hasn't happened in half a lifetime, nobody really saw it coming, and it's going to take ages for most of the market to catch up, if they do at all. Because the market changes so abruptly in response to world events, but you have to be in the market for so long to get a decent return over the original amount.

Maybe you'll miss out on a post WW2 American type boom... Or maybe you'll miss out on another 1929 crash. No way of knowing.

Roi on the market over 20 years is 7% for an annuity like the lotto it's 1-3%.

You'll more than double your money taking the lump and plugging into the market. For example in this scenario listed above they get $433 mil.

7% doubles up every 10 years. So 866 in 10 1732 in 20 and 3464 in 30 compared to the 1280 over the same time from the annuity in the lotto assuming 30 years which is more the standard. Which actually nets out to just under triple.

I know if you opt for the annuity for Powerball and you pass away, the distribution of winnings are then passed to your estate. There are also many who claim the prize under a trust, in which case the winnings continue to be passed to the trust.

Can the distribution of remaining annuity payments be specified in a will?  
Yes, lottery annuity holders can include instructions in their will regarding the distribution of remaining annuity payments to beneficiaries of their choice.

What people don't understand is that they are not "winning" a cash prize.

They are winning government bonds, and the number up on the board is the expected value of those bonds in 30 years.

So if you won the 1 billion dollar powerball, you're only actually winning 520 million in cash value.

Then you lose the 27 percent (ish) taxes on it.

Because technically, you're not gambling but using your abilities to "work for it".

hmmmm So they pay the tax for you. Also, seems like they are private companies but the fact that you don't pay taxes on the winnings in specific lotteries that probably just pay the tax for you instead and not a general thing.

You'll also have to pay out the ass in taxes every year for the next 30 years instead of just a one time sting, and hope that taxes don't go through the roof...And you're gonna be stuck in the highest tax bracket for any and all income that entire time. When you could be in the capital gains tax categories instead. 

It's standard financial practice to maximize current cash in hand, to reinvest and put that money to work. The sooner it's somewhere more productive than their low risk annuity, the better. Obviously it's life changing money either way, but I just wouldn't want the hassle of paying uncle same out the ass every year for 30 years instead of just once. And pay more overall doing it

This makes the lump sum math more understandable. still would consider the possibilities on 9figure+ wins, especially against the "just make your own annuity" type answers.

with the massive jackpots i'd actually argue that there's no reason not to take the annuity.

No matter how good you think you might be, the annuity is a guarantee and the amount you get every year is so astronomical you really don't need "more," and you're safeguarded against even terribly worst case, e.g. market crashes and such because you'll just get another 8 figures the next year.

I understand why lump sum is "usually considered the better idea," just think that at the massive upper ends i feel like the logic breaks down

80% of lottery jackpot winners are completely broke by the 5 year mark and 95% of lottery jackpot winners are completely broke by the 10 year mark. My plan would be to take the annuity because while I do think I'd be capable of not going broke, it would give me a chance to blow it all, next year get another payment, blow it all, next year get another payment, blow almost all of it, next year get another payment, start to figure out how to handle it, next year get another payment, etc and then possibly not end up part of the group that went broke.

Same as Australians get surprised at the checkout in the US because something ticketed as $5 ends up costing $5.05, whereas the law here is that the ticketed price must be the full cost. The amount paid is the same  its just jarring at first.  Neither is better or worse, just different

--->--->--->--->--->--->--->This is literally what happens when you take the yearly annuity payment. The "Lump sum" payment is the actual amount of prize money available. The bigger number that gets advertised and draws people in to play is that lump sum invested into a annuity that is guaranteed to pay out that higher sum over time because it's using bonds and other low risk investments. That annuity contract can also be sold at any time by the winner if they decide they want to cash it in on the open market 

 If anyone has noticed the spread between the cash payment and the yearly payment has become wider lately because the interest rates on bonds have increased the last couple years. That's also why the advertised jackpots seem larger lately

TL:DR: taking the lump sum and investing it and only "living off the interest" is EXACTLY the same thing as what an annuity does.

Besides that, investing 1 billion is enough to shake the stock itself, which means you have to massively diversify your portfolio. Getting maybe 2-5% (of their total savings) gain per year.

That means instead of the 7-8% that "we" would get doubling every 10 years. Billionaires will only be able to double (net worth) every 20-30 years.

That's also not taking into account insider trading, which you would certainly have access to at that level. This could probably boost you up to levels in the +15% range, but I'm not 100% sure on how it would work.

Figures like this are believed by many to be a myth. There's a similar one that gets thrown around that 70% of winners go bankrupt in five years, which was not determined by surveying winners, but by surveying economists who supposed it was that amount on average, back in 2001.

Fact is its not exactly easy to survey winners who keep it private or disappear with the money. It is easy to survey winners who go bankrupt because they often end up on the news, which only fuels confirmation bias that winners routinely go bankrupt, then add on the fact people love to shit on people who play the lottery.

In fact, no matter what the amount is they can deliver *today*, being able to market it as a much higher 30 year annuity value drives more people to play the lottery, thus bringing more money into the system while also making the prizes higher.

Fuck the lottery, it's a stupid predatory system that preys on gambling addiction and struggling people.  But, so long as we're not going to ban gambling entirely (which, honestly, I'm for, but would be very hard to actually achieve), people will find ways to gamble.

You have relatives, who will ask for money, you have scammers, who want your money, you may not understand the economy at all, so buying a big house without maintenance can transform it into cheap real estate. You can break Bugatti each week, because you don't care, as you can buy another. There are literally thousands of ways to waste millions which you never earned. Unless you really have a plan, it will be wasted 90% of the time. And it will be very fast on top of that, not decades, but like 5-8 years easily.

People don't need to have more than 10-20mil to have a comfortable life for them and their children, if everything is planned and weighted correctly. Imagine receiving 40x more than such a plan. Do you think that you will do everything correctly? And don't talk about finance advisors. If you have no knowledge, a scam will be very easy.

The big difference between the USA and some other countries (such as my own), is that the USA doesn't seem to allow citizens to be non-resident for tax purposes. Briefly, we have a set of criteria used to decide whether people who normally reside overseas are liable to pay tax here. Other than that, all earnings worldwide are subject to tax, with a deduction for any tax paid in the country where the income is earnt.

I don't think I'd be able to spend all of it without drastically increasing my hooker and blow consumption by a solid 1000%.

There are also caveats to winning the lottery. My friend won the $1k a week for life, but it got revoked because he went to jail for getting caught with an absolute massive amount of cocaine, which was for a party he was having. He went to prison for like 2 years, and lost the money. I don't remember if he had to pay any back, or if there were penalties, but dude went from making like $52k a year for having a pulse, to needing to get a real job. 

There could be a stipulation that says you have to stay out of jail during the length of the annuity or something. I've never won a jackpot that large so I'll never know.

Basically you are about 900 times as likely to win if you buy a ticket, but the chances are so astronomically low that is not even a rounding error on increasing your overall odds. Imagine if you dropped a single grain of sand into a 2500 pound pile of sand, and then stirred that sand up for over an hour, and had to pick the one grain you dropped in there by picking out one grain. Now imagine your odds of getting that one grain with a single scoop of a teaspoon...that is the only difference buying a ticket gives you.

Well, usually, you sit on it and start pushing. After excrement has left your bottom orifice; you use some toilet paper to clean your orifice. Finally, you firmly press on the flushing handle to send your excrement to the sewers. Don't forget to wash your hands afterward. You can keep some bar soaps in the 3 seashells you have on the counter.

Shell #1 is to scrape all the poop off your butt. Shell #2 is to scrape the poop from shell #1 into the toilet. Shell #3 is to wipe away any remaining poop off your butt, and then use shell #2 to scrape as you did with #1.

We got to get one of my coworkers about this a while ago. Another couple coworkers and I were talking about Demolition Man and someone mentioned something about the "three sea shells". My other coworker had never seen the movie and asked "what's with the three sea shells". I finally got to get somebody "this guy doesn't know how to use the three sea shells!".

The big bowl attached to the floor is called a toilet. You relieve yourself in it. Don’t mistake it for the other large bowl, called a sink or the shell shaped bowls. Leaving your bodily waste an any of these will cause the owner of the home to hurt you.

Also, remember to jiggle the handle on the bowl when finished. Otherwise, the next person to use that bowl will get a very unpleasant surprise.

Jokes aside, I have always thought the 3 seashells, operated the bidet,  since there was no toilet paper. one for front #1 (women) one for rear (for #2 both sexes) and the last one for #1 and #2 for women.   or maybe to dry, as the other two could cover all "bases".

You're inquiring about the precise meaning of "these things."

Commencing with the sink: it serves for hand and face washing; manipulate the lever or knobs to facilitate water flow.

Regarding the toilet: assume a seated position and relieve yourself. Ensure pants removal precedes this act.

Adjacent to it is the shower. Stand beneath it and adjust the wall-mounted knob nearby. Water will emanate from the showerhead. Once again, disrobing beforehand is advisable.

Indeed, life is challenging, and there's much to absorb, but we've all traversed these experiences.

The first button turns on commercial jingles so you don't have to offended by your own noises. It also releases a pleasing pina colada smell for that joy joy feeling.

So as you shit, you have to separate it in three parts. Get that first long one out in a nice swirl. Then the second really dense part on the second shell. Then leave all the liquid refuse in the third shell. Then either dump in the toilet, but if you get the presentation right like I said present it to your girlfriend, wife, mother, sister, meth head! 😅

Yea you sit on the seat, squeeze your stomach and if you did it just right a nice chocolate surprise will come out (beware it can make you sick if you eat it) there should be a silver handle that you push down to flush it away, then use the tissue next to you otherwise known as toilet paper to clean yourself. Now the way you clean yourself is you fold it into a square. Do this until you get a few leayers deep (3-4 is optimal) wipe the hole between tour butt cheeks with it, then you check. If it's it's brown you put in the toilet then wipe again and flush after every 2nd or third wipe and repeat until there's no more poopoo on the paper. (Baby wipes helps near the end of the process if you feel there's nothing left to wipe using regular toilet paper)

Yes. You put the sheet of toilet paper under one shell (invert the other two as well).  Close eyes and randomly shuffle all three shells… then choose the one you think the sheet is under.  You have only time for 1 guess

\-If its the shower : just stand on the small tiles and turn the nobs on the wall, water will come out. Red nob to add warm water and bleu nob for cold water.  
\-If its the toilet : no pants, sit on ring and pee or poo  
\-If its the shells : Just put soap on it and grab them wen washing hands and put back

I always sit when I use the toilet. The shower can be tricky. I’m always hoping to find a woman to spend time tutoring me. The sink? Depends what I’m doing. But, I think I have that one down. Reply if you have a specific question. I’ve no idea why you would put a gulf coast themed candy dish in a bathroom. That’s kinda gross.

You put them in the floor in front of the toilet, then fill them with urine until they’re almost overflowing. When they’re full, you stomp on the edge that’s closest to the toilet and the urine will fly up in a perfect arc, go over your head and land in the toilet without a drop being spilled. It may take a few tries to get it just right but stick with it, it’s really convenient after you get it figured out.

There are about 11 "things" in this picture depending on whether you'd count some things as one or two and depending on what you consider "in" the picture.

AI guess.

The "three seashells" in the movie "Demolition Man" are a famously mysterious and unexplained concept. Here's a speculative and comprehensive guess on how they could work:

1. **Seashell 1 - Scooping:** The first seashell might be used for scooping. It could be ergonomically designed to help in gently scraping or scooping to clean the area. This seashell would be used first to ensure most of the waste is removed.

2. **Seashell 2 - Spraying:** The second seashell could function as a sprayer. Once the majority of waste is removed with the first seashell, this one could spray a cleaning solution or water to further cleanse the area. It could work similarly to a bidet, but more localized and controlled.

3. **Seashell 3 - Drying:** The final seashell might be used for drying. It could emit warm air or even use some sort of absorbent technology to ensure the area is dry and clean. This would be the last step in the process.

Each seashell could have sensors or be automated in some way to ensure hygiene and effectiveness. They would likely be self-cleaning or have a sanitizing feature to maintain cleanliness after each use.

You can have 3 soap bars with different scents on each shell. You can also put it anywhere in your house to store keys or coins.

I'm not trying to be a smart \*\*\*.  Are you talking about the soap dishes?  You fill them with decorative soap and put them on the back of the commode or on a shelf in the bathroom. The soap smells good and looks pretty.  

Again, this is what I'm understanding your question to be.  I'm just assuming that you've never encountered decorative soap before.  If I've misunderstood, apologies.

Went on a surf trip to the middle of Baja about 10yrs ago… middle of nowhere, camping.

Buddy took the first poop, went around the point and when he came back he said he used the 3 seashell method.

When it was my turn I saw there was a nice open area, plenty of seashells, and a big obvious pile of sand with 3 seashells neatly places on top.

My theory on the three seashells is that they where actually just buttons to control a bidet. People always assume they where meant to be used physically, but I think they just used seashells as buttons because it's more ecologically friendly.

Sometime after Demolition Man was released, Sylvester Stallone revealed that a screenwriter on the film had explained to him how to use the three seashells: Use the first and second like "chopsticks" to pull the feces out of your anus, then use the third to scrape away any remaining waste.

--->--->Nearly everything that has been said so far (with exception to the colonoscopy references about the age of those who remember the movie) has been quotes from an American movie released in 1994 called  Demolition Man. It was an action comedy starring Wesley Snipes, Sylvester Stallone, and Sandra Bullock. If you haven't watched it, it is definitely worth finding.

The premise is that a cop (Stallone), who has been cryogenically frozen, is thawed in the future to help catch the first killer seen in several decades- a criminal that Stallone's character originally caught(Snipes). There are many comedic scenes involving culture and technology shifts that Stallone's character deals with in typical Stallone fashion- the sea shells (found in the bathroom where there is no toilet paper) are one such scene and are never explained in the movie. The movie is a cult classic and, as you can see, a favorite

As funny and sweet as that scene was, you have to be *real* desperate to use fine paper as toilet paper.

It's either got the consistency of receipt paper, which is akin to wiping your ass with thin plastic, 

or the cheapest, sharpest notepad stock you can find. 3 words:

Rectal Paper Cut.

I have thought about that scene for like 25 years, and I still shudder at the thought of using that paper to wipe my ass.

It is an action comedy in which a cryogenically frozen cop (Stallone) is thawed to deal with the first murderer seen in several decades (WesleySnipes). The culture and technology changes are used as comedic relief throughout the movie

--->--->--->--->--->Interesting.  I'm in Australia and have only seen Demolition Man on TV but I'm pretty sure it was Taco Bell that was referenced, despite the chain not having a presence here when the movie was released.   

But I'm wondering if the TV cut I saw might have dated to a brief attempt to get Taco Bell started here in the late 1990s.   It failed, but a later attempt from 2017 has succeeded on a modest scale.   

The other possibility is that they just figured we Australians watch so much American TV that we'd know who Taco Bell was.

Like, it was based of a 1920s comic strip. Was published as a collaborative effort between american and japanese films companies in the 80s, but didnt get to the US until then 90s. A bunch of different directors worked on it, included Hiyao Miyazaki (and a bunch of other people from Studio Ghibli (this was before Studio Ghibli was a thing)).

in all seriousness, it's not really that crazy. the combination isn't something I'd seek out, but I could see all these elements being in the same dish, like a bowl of sweet and spicy stir-fry, rice, or noodles.

Sweet and savory go well together and the onions would add that oniony element. Honestly, if this sandwhich had two fried eggs on it, it'd be really really good. For those of you who don't have the taste buds of a toddler, think about it for a moment. Have you ever had a biscuit (or scone for the bruvs) with eggs and jam on it? It's great. Now imagine those eggs being an omelet with onions in it. It's a normal biscuit. So the addition of peanut butter to it isn't too big of a leap

This could really work. Those of us who have been here long enough know how stupid food can get. But this? this isn't really stupid at all if you've eaten a variety of things through out your life and can imagine how the addition of something would make it work. Even a piece of meat would work with this, like a sausage patty, but I think (with this amount of onions) two fried eggs with a little salt and pepper would be better. If the assignment allowed you to reduce the number of onions, one fried egg would be enough.

Now, would I try this? Probably not. I'm not a fan of peanut butter or making sandwiches. but if someone made it for me, I'd eat it. Could even throw in some bacon on it with the eggs now that I think about it.

Peanut butter and onion is good. It was very popular nearly 100 years ago. 

The sulfur in the onion and the saltiness of the peanut butter mix well. I love peanut butter but turned up my nose when I heard this at first. But it's just as good, or better than,  peanut butter and pickle.

Actually, grape jelly or margarine with red onion slices might be better!

Edit: just noticed jelly/jam in second photo

Short story: I loved crunchy peanut butter but when I got braces I couldn't have it. When the braces came off and I tried crunchy PB, I felt that the peanut pieces were too big and it was hard for me to tolerate. On a whim, I tried Bacos (imitation bacon bits) and topped the PB with them. The texture was much better, but omg the taste was fantastic!

Death is too good for you. Just know some day some god will demand answers for your sin. No amount of good will earn you any sympathy nor pity. Once you come with no answer as to why you butchered the culinary arts like a sacrificial lamb and cursed your brothers and sisters in humanity's eyes with this unholy monstrosity you will suffer true horror. What ever torment and torture this god will subject you to will no matter how eldritch, no matter how horrifyingly painful will come close to the suffering you have is bear witness to for the rest of our now cursed existences on this planet.

I like onions (used to eat them raw regularly) and I love peanut butter (have a $100 peanut butter order from a specialty shop 1800 miles away on the way), but this is an absolute disaster to me. To be fair, I don’t love jam that much. I did like it a lot when I was young, but I tend to shy away from a lot of sugary things that are not ice cream these days.

Edit: The fact that you enjoyed this is putting me in an awkward position, though. I am likely going to have to try it now and hate myself for doing it. I will use the spicy peanut butter that is on the way in my order.

I like mine with a half-way good slice of cheese.

Other things to try: toasting the bread, caramelizing the onion to various degrees, using Balsamic jelly, put a slice of a strong-smelling cheese on the onion, and if you have a kitchen torch you can attempt to 'caramelize' the peanut butter.  Try different types of nut butters.  Also great with dry patted herring slices pickled in white wine and/or banana slices. 

Yes, it sounds horrendous, however, the unique melding of discontinuous flavor notes combine to something I believe is the equivalent of playing/listening to really good jazz with your taste buds and sensory perceptions.  Other people's mileage may vary.

Then, at the end, after we watch all 2 minutes and 38 seconds of you preparing some weird concoction of ingredients, we end up with this PB&O sandwich.

I mean, it’s not that out there. A lot of restaurants serve peanut butter hamburgers/cheeseburgers. Many are topped with onion. And other typical burger toppings. This is that only less. 

No on the other hand, I worked at Panera about 20 years ago. An old lady regular always ordered a cinnamon crunch bagel with jelly… and tuna salad. That was disturbing.

I’ll be real. Sometimes there are flavors we’ve never considered. Pregnant women experience this phenomenon in the form of odd cravings. Through my experience there are some odd flavor combos that are worth it

I’ve had:

Chocolate covered bacon - certified banger

Watermelon with a dash of yellow mustard - tastes like a vinaigrette 

Coca Cola with peanuts - never again

Blueberry Ketchup - 10/10

I’m sure there’s more but if you like it, there’s a chance that it’s actually good

I always say that onions improve almost everything except sweet foods, so I guess it depends whether PB&J counts as sweet. Onion works with peanut butter, I have tried that myself, but I have never added jelly at the same time. My gut tells me it probably won't work, but PB&Js themselves are already a combination that shouldn't work but somehow do.

I am afraid to say it, but I fear I can't mock it until I try it

Honestly, and I’m sorry that I can actually say this, but that is not the worst thing I’ve seen added to a peanut butter sandwich. I don’t want to even mention what the worst was because I don’t want to be responsible for a bunch of people getting sick just from reading about it. Just know that onions are damn tame by comparison.

You deserve near death, you deserve to be tortured for hours, days, months, YEARS! you deserve to be put through so much pain that your mind snaps and your spirit withers, such cruel torture that Kim jong would have nightmares, there is no saving your body or your soul, you have done condemned for the resto of your natural live, how ever long it might be, you will stay up every night in agonising pain begging for the sweet release of death, but it will never come because you will be tortured to near death then have your wounds retreated but only enough so you don't die, you will be a sadists personal play thing and live the rest of your days as such only knowing pain with the constant reminder that you deserve it four you have sinned.
REPENT AND MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL, IF IT IS RIGHT TO DO SO, BECAUSE WE HAVE RUN OUT OF MERCY AND WE WILL PUNISH YOU, SINNER

The fact you added onion to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is jarring enough, but raw onion!

At least onion cooked mellows out and even brings sweetness. I know people who love raw onion. It’s way too pungent for my taste. The thing is that I love hot mustard, wasabi, garlic and other similar foods but raw onion doesn’t do it for me. So this sandwich is receiving hard judgement, lol.

Take the entire sandwich throw it in a pan with enough oil to sauté,breaking it up with a spatula like ground beef. Keep going until everything is minced and crispy. Make a salad, drizzle on olive oil, sesame oil, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper then sprinkle on your pbj onion sandwich crumbles. That’s how you eat this and enjoy it 👍

--->--->--->--->I don't have the gene and I still don't like cilantro. It doesn't taste like soap to me, it just tastes overpowering and dominates the flavor of anything it's added to, even in small amounts. I like things made without it much better (vs versions of the same thing with it) because I can actually taste the other ingredients when it isn't there.

But I recently found out that I may be a super taster; for example, I had no idea until a few months ago that most people can't taste or smell cucumber. They like it for the watery crunch and texture. I, on the other hand, can smell when a cucumber is being cut from all the way across a large room, and don't like the flavor of it at all (and like cilantro, it has a very strong flavor to me). Apparently the cucumber thing is a trademark attribute of super tasters.

Also, I used to feel negatively about tasting it like this because I thought that there was a part of it that I couldn’t taste but it turns out it’s a part of it that everyone else can’t taste and for some reason that perspective makes me feel better about it.

There's a chemical in cucumber that gives it its taste and aroma (as with everything) but most people can't detect it.

You bet your pretty ass that the circle jerk retaliated. #JusticeForPP was hot for a minute. The gardening sub became private for a minute, then got unlocked. It became a joke and everyone started commenting PP, which automatically resulted in a ban.

Elmo asks a sweet, innocent question. Everyone trauma dumps on him. Sesame Street’s Twitter links resources for help if people need it. Nearly all of the Sesame Street characters check in to say sweet things. Biden sends encouragement. 

Everything feels like such a dumpster fire sometimes and this was just good and kind and sweet and caring and wonderful

On a related note, if you're having a hard time with loneliness, that's ok, you're only human. If you have the means to do so, I would encourage people to look into adopting a pet. Having my cats and dogs around has been one of the best things I've done to combat the loneliness and make things feel more ok instead of the existential doom that comes from feeling isolated.

Everyone talking about how Fox News is going to turn this into some culture war talking point is right, but not for the reasons you think.

This has me all misty eyed. It can be easy to forget that not everyone is a total jerk and not everything is going to shite. If you watch our ‘news’ lately that is how it seems. I used to open my Reddit and see funny things, interesting things, and relevant information. Now I just see posts about Texas fighting with the Federal Government as if there is no way to come to an agreement. I see the posts of a bafoon ranting about how he’s done nothing wrong and everyone else is the problem. I see more examples of racism, transphobia and other forms of hate and otherism. I could go on… 

Maybe seeing Elmo will remind us that we all could use a hug and that we were all once innocent children with a lot of wide eyed hope for the future. Let’s be friends, ya’ll.

Corporations just trying to get likes off a popular post.

Spotify could pay artists more and more fairly split the pot.  
Xbox introduced the concept of paying for online play and so many other "anti consumer" practices.  
MTV who make their money exploiting "freaks" in their reality shows.  
And Google who scrubbed "Don't be Evil" from their business, so they could be evil.

*... LMFAO!*

as of right now ALL those big companies in this thread would rather extinct us all than do even a tiny thing to improve the mental health of any of their lowest paid employees.   

How many of those companies in this thread are grabbing congresss and the house of representatives or other governmental figures by the balls to enforce universal mental health care ? How about increased length and coverage of paid leave for employees experiencing mental health decline !? And how about housing for all law-obeying, tax-paying citizens!?

Is Joe Bidet doing any of these?! 

Are any of these entities doing anything to reduce other issues which are definitely eroding the mental health of peoples such as wealth inequality, the impending cataclysms of global warming, incompetent governmental figures having access to nuclear weapons without civilian input, and the increasingly apparent monotony in the lives of people? 

...Mhm. These 'fEeL gOoD' posts with just words ALWAYS make me feel worse cause it makes it increasingly more apparent to me how all of this fuckshit is just an elaborate façade funded by the billionaires and oligarchs who control the world. *I no longer feel good until drastic positive action is taken to improve the mental health of me and those who are as disadvantaged as me*

Id recommend everyone here join in boycotting products from Israel , Russia and continue to support real democratic movements like the ones going on in Myanmar and Burkina Faso. And continue to ensure that their workplace becomes or remains unionized. And actually take real action to improve the mental health of themselves and those around them for asking for greater mental health resources.

*Words have been, are, and will always be useless because* **people can lie.** *They do all the time. We have all seen politicians and companies do that. Actions never are useless though...*

--->I cannot emphasize enough how much I really hate this timeline. Any kindness or compassion for your fellow humans somehow becomes an inadvertent weapon for the right wing mouthpieces. We’ve come to literally expect this to be major right wing talking point because of the laughably terrible precedents they have set. I’m so tired of this country as a whole acting like a teenager while masquerading as an adult.

It might not seem that special now. But if you think back on kids TV shows in the 70s and 80s, it was pretty solely focused on middle class suburbia.

I want to clarify though that sometimes it’s us, the Social Media People, reaching out from behind the keys because we are having a bad day, or because something hits just the right nostalgia note, or because we can’t bear to stay quiet just this one time.

Sometimes that’s corp sanctioned, sometimes it’s not. There were days when I really did need to retweet or comment on that Disney post or bit of George Takei snark because it was the only thing keeping me sane behind my keyboard and letting me reconnect with the people I was supposed to be helping and engaging with.

--->--->>In an astonishing turn of events, Sesame Street's beloved character Elmo is now being touted as the latest pawn in the woke agenda, according to some dubious sources. Critics argue that Elmo's emphasis on kindness and inclusivity is nothing more than a thinly veiled liberal conspiracy aimed at indoctrinating the nation's youth. The puppet's relentless push for empathy and understanding is seen as a dangerous attempt to sway young minds toward a more progressive ideology. As Elmo continues to spread his message of tolerance and friendship, skeptics claim that this so-called "niceness" is just a facade for a broader agenda to undermine traditional values. Whether you believe in the puppet masterminds pulling the strings or see this as an innocent attempt to promote positive values, the debate over Elmo's alleged liberal influence is certainly one for the books.

--->--->> Rural men commit suicide at WAY higher rates.

It's hard to get evidence on this, but while this is true it isn't clear to me if they *attempt* suicide more.

The key difference is rural men have a high rate of gun ownership and therefore use guns during their attempt, and suicide attempts with guns result in death at vastly higher rates than all other methods. It's very likely it's the gun ownership that leads to higher suicide rate rather than any other difference. Two key reasons why is that shooting yourself with a gun has a high fatality rate, and that it's an easier method to attempt than others. It's a bad combination.

It's also worth noting that people who survive suicide attempts are *not* particularly likely to try it again, so if they didn't have access to a gun they 1) might not try at all, and 2) even if they did they would be more likely to survive the attempt.

Two things can be true at once.

Typically it's not an AI who is managing the socials, and these sorts of responses aren't automated. You can safely bet that there is a human person behind the screen, not always the same one but still a person nonetheless. It's a job and the brand benefits from it, but the human is also experiencing their own thoughts and feelings on the subject matter and what they're posting.

Social isolation and loneliness are risk factors for suicide, and physical isolation (ie. living in a rural area) increases the likelihood of both. Being in lower socioeconomic groups is also a risk factor, which is more likely in rural areas.

I’m just putting it out here that there are, in fact, humans in there and that they do often feel the way they are projecting outward onto social media. In fact we are often chosen for teams because we are the people who represent “what the brand would be if it were a person.”

There is definitely no critique from my end, more just a reminder that every big machine is made up of a lot of small cogs and bolts…well, until you get to the top. Then it’s mostly big, expensive nuts.

--->--->--->No worries, I absolutely took that as genuine…which probably shows why I got so stressed in that line of work. The first year was the woooooorst. I worked for a major car company in the US, and there were a lot of “my car stopped working and [terrible thing happened]” stories to try to work with and eventually put a spin on. I got flagged for trying to put too many people through to support *so many times.* 

Then a major airbag recall happened across a ton of automakers and I realized I had turned into Mr Incredible, just telling people very explicitly who *not* to call and why I definitely *wouldn’t* try going through social media to solve x,y,z and crying to myself when they couldn’t read between the lines of our heavily monitored messages. That was the year they disbanded our small team to go for major damage control instead, and I started doing small gigs and coaching friends and family on how to advocate for themselves on social media.

(slightly related PSA: Seriously though if you have a problem with a company, @ them on all social media and Facebook and make sure your profiles are squeaky clean or private)

--->--->--->--->--->Sorry to single you out, but it really annoys me when people say this. There are other alternatives - they just lose in the primaries. We've got Dean Philips, Nikki Haley, Trump, and Biden right now, not to mention Marianne Williamson, Ryan Binkley, RFK Jr., Cornel West, and Jill Stein. Lots of alternatives. (Too many, honestly; many of these are completely unserious and/or are only running to spoil other candidates.) What you actually *mean* when you say "I wish there were more alternatives" is "I wish my political views were the most popular and my favored candidate would make it out of the primaries". But if you put it that way, it's like... duh. We all wish that. But only one person ends up being the most popular. Biden's going to be in the general election not because there are "no alternatives", but because the alternatives will have already lost the popularity contest by then.

Instead, I'll continue to see "the left" slide more and more to the right, and given that "the right" is now openly promoting fascism, beginning to lay the seeds for removing women's suffrage (how tf did we get *there*), and openly calling for elimination of their political opposition, I will be continually forced to vote for "the left", which let's be honest is basically a right wing moderate almost anywhere else.

Here is the context:

* The clip is from 1980 and back then transsexual transition was not a widely accepted treatment by the medical community.
* The song they quote addresses small children being afraid that playing with opposite gendered toys might turn them into that gender.  Yeah that was a thing back then (the past is the worst).
* The intended audience was children in the 70's and early 80's
* This is Fred Rogers, the man loved everybody... if we were blessed with him to be alive today making his show I can guarantee he would have a trans person on it as one of his neighbors.

i asked for clarification because 'left' in an american context means 'not conservative' and includes e.g. liberals who are on the right side of the whole political spectrum. to my knowledge they don't identify as 'leftists' even if they'll say they're on the left or lean left. they're just sort of progressive and support some social welfare programs maybe.

my original comment was inflammatory but also serious. i'm like 90% sure this sub at least used to be run by communists. a lot of people left/got replaced during the api shitshow. i've used reddit less since then so i'm genuinely not sure how various subs i used to be more familiar with have changed. i'm not a leftist, but for active subreddits i'm limited to leftist ones like this, 196, and gcj for communities that are more general/fun but also ideologically close enough to me that i don't have to see... well posts like this.

Oh I assure you, there are a disturbing number of people on Facebook who still believe that. 

The article you linked really nails the topic on the head. The things he said weren't a shot at trans people, because trans acceptance was not a major part of the public discourse at the time. Not that there weren't people out there struggling with it, but it wasn't something people talked about.


Fuck, considering the song's basically about accepting who you are, it could even be interpreted as trans positive. A girls a girl right from the start, even if the outside doesnt reflect their inside.

In the US, yea, almost none of us are socialists, let alone commies and we are the majority of reddit. Relative to the world and Europe, this sub is still prob about in the center but leans right on the econ scale since that's what you're asking about. The vast majority of the world are capitalists though /shrug

Wait.. wait this is wrong..

Im gen X, boomers are not our parents. They are our parents little brothers. They are millenial's parents.

We dont have boomers talking down on us.

We also dont talk to millenials like that, cos they are not our kids. Gen Z are our kids.. Zs are like what they are now because they are raised by Xs

(and some gen alpha too.. cos we Xs got married later compared to boomers)

Unless this refer to workplace instead of home setting...

But workplace setting also doesnt make sense cos most of gen Z are still in highschool/uni.

Maybe some zennials, but they are too close to most  millenials so.. juat wont make much difference.

- Imho boomers raised & affect millenials, therefore has the most impact on them.


- Silent generation raised X, Z raised (or still raises)  Z.

Parents of this generation are in for a real treat in their old age if this is how they see themselves.  I know it's supposed to be jokey but there is just so much wrong with focusing your energy shitting on the old and patting yourself on the back.  

Our generation is raising the anxiety generation and is culpable for it.  Social media is absolutely horrible for development, and the resulting lack of sleep, confidence, outdoor activity,  etc is crippling.

A lot gets dismissed as "we're just better at diagnosing problems" when very obvious issues gets raised.

You don't need positivity everywhere in your life or you will just slide in the shit and stuck in a shit hole and you Only realize once you in it.
And to our parents don't think you can teach any and everything without learning/studying it and debate it or reflect on it until you get positive out come to teach your children and if you didn't get it and have 0 knowledge then go to someone who knows that has a kind heart and good intentions or just don't have children.

The cringe doesn't exist except in our minds. It's a product of cringing from the internalized judgement. Otherwise, the "cringe" actions are just normal and healthy development.

I think growing up is not caring anymore about cringe. I mean, a lot of adults and I are cringe sometimes, and no one cares anymore. Is not being "cringe free" but being "I'm cringe and don't care". That's why dad jokes exist and we old folk laugh about it.

I never had this experience at all. My grandparents born in the 30s were the most loving people ever. My grandfather always wanted a hug and told me he loved me.

My parents were late boomers. 61 and 64. They are loving. Always told me there were proud of me and always have supported me in my endeavors or dreams. 

I was born in 84 and try to support my kids, make sure they know I love them and I’m proud of them. 

Sometimes I don’t always understand them especially my gen Z daughter but I’m always there for her and have her back.

My two gen alpha kids are different from me as well and that’s fine.  My 9 year old teaches me about technology.

As a Gen X all I can tell you is every generation thinks they are the best and that they are doing life right. 

Millennials and Gen Z’ers, just know that you will dislike the generation right after yours, hate the generation after that and absolutely abhor your great-grandkids’ generation. 

Enjoy this time when you think you’re doing it all well, soon enough a whole new batch of humans will arrive to tell you how much better you could have done. Enjoy!

Late gen-x here, do your best, you are gonna fail many many times until you get it right the important thing is keep doing it and improving it but is very important to listen to others and learn from others that's how you realize how to improve whatever you do.
Learn to distinguish what feedback is helpful and discard the rest, there's always something positive to learn even in the worst cases.

IIRC, this is also a parenting method for when teens are being mean/dumb. You let them know that one day they will look back and cringe at their behavior, just like you did when you realized how cringe you were as a teen. Basically that “you’re mad now but you’ll thank me when you’re an adult” thing.

I think the internet might actually break this trend. So much information easily passes between people. It's not like my parents time when trends built up in little regional pockets and slowly passed through society.

 It's hard to see generational differences between millennials and Gen Z. We spend the same time browsing the same random topics on the internet to the point we all get the same memes, play the same games, fall into the same algorithms to make us want to buy whatever advertisers want us to. Even my Gen X mom knows what's "in" with the grandkids.

As Gen X, I take offense with that.   I healed some serious generational trauma with my Gen Z kids.   They're fully fucking amazing and take no shit from no one. 

There's a cousins' group chat with the early teenagers and college kids that totally bag on their boomer grandma (whom they all love) because she's so passive aggressive about their style/ hair/ all the boomer things. 

But they know she's got them 💯 so, they just laugh amongst themselves.

I’m a 1979 baby and this is how I am with my son. If he does something that I don’t think is appropriate I let him know about it, and I make sure to let him know that it’s ok that everyone tries different ways of doing things, and I make sure to explain what I think would be a better way of doing it. 

I’m what I call an explainer. I don’t know of a better way of describing it. 
But I find myself explaining everything I can to him, in an effort to get him to understand the ‘why’ of things. I think it’s because that’s the best way for me to understand things. 

Also, I do it privately. I never do this when we’re in front of other people. I don’t wanna ever embarrass him, and this way I know he’ll be able to understand me better if it’s just us.

This meme is about intergenerational standards and claims there is a break at millennials, but then the millennial calls their kid a negative term just like the generations before them. Maybe just be supportive and kind instead. 

You think the boomers weren't like, I was stupid at your age too? It's the same thing just a new term. It's improving, but it is still forcing kids to grow up fast and it's not helpful or healthy. Every generation, besides the kid, in this meme is guilty of the same thing, forcing old standards on the next generation. Disgusting that y'all see this and think this shows actual evolution just because it uses a new trendy term.

They also still think you can basically show up and exist and get into college, get an entry level job in any industry, and that school  is affordable and jobs pay enough for you to afford a small place to live.  They can only remember their own experience in youth where you basically had to be a fucking stoned idiot to not fall ass backwards into a livable life and assume that's still true now no matter how many people scream and shout. Ultimately since it's not their life they can choose to believe whatever reality makes them feel good as they've been a generation who has always had things go their way and can't have it any other way.

--->>Man i dont Live in América so maybe its different but why do you all hate grandpa's so much?

The meme started in the 2010s. In the wake of the global financial crisis, many Millenials had a hard time finding work while their boomer parents would tell them out of touch advice like "you need to just go into a business cold, look the manager in the eye and shake his hand, then he'll give you a job."

Then, just as things were looking up in the second half of the decade, they decided to wreck the economy because they were too fat and diabetic to withstand a strain of the flu.

Those of us who wanted to break the cycle of abuse largely just didn't have kids and tried to end our own family lines, or are vastly delaying when we have kids. The millennials who have kids either didn't grow up experiencing abuse to know not to do it or are mirroring their parents/grandparents.

The entire concept of the generation groups…is to highlight the differences in human behavior that are caused by the changing of cultural and social norms throughout history.

Boomers (1946-64), on the other hand, were born too young to be affected by major conflicts or struggles. They were born into "the golden age of capitalism" (1951-1973). 

They didn't have to sacrifice or live through the great depression, they just misconstrued the teachings of their greatest generation parents to mean "demand respect from younger generations" rather than understanding why their war survivor parents actually had respect. 

The boomers became hippies, counter culture against wars and corporate 'squares'. They later became parents and thought that respect came simply with age, rather than sacrifice.

Let me elaborate:

Boomers were born 1946-64, we can say those who were born 46-50 still more relateable to silent gen than boomers in general (those who were born in the 50s-early 60s)

Now gen X are born 1965 to 1980 (some say till 85, but lately they use "xenials" for 80-85)

For average boomers (born 50s) to have average gen x kids (born 70s),  they have to be married very early (in their late teens, very early 20s)... sure boomers married early compared to later generations, but even then, married in their teens were exception and not the rule.

---

You might be the exception cos your boomers mom married in her teen.

Or you might be late gen x (born 80s) from early boomers (born in the 40s)... but this is also exception.

Cos your generational experience is closer to average  xenials, or your parent life experience more match with the silent gen than boomers in general (or at least somewhere in between)

---

Tldr, you are exception not the rule.

He’s since been hired full time and we were lucky to have him. He’s moved on to another team and we are really proud. He also has a non-jaded attitude and has great work balance.

The generations in this definitions tend to be 15 year increments or so and are based around informative year differences.

The greatest generation were shaped by war

Boomers were the baby boom after.

Gen Y was the turn of the millennium and the rise of the internet.

Gen Z are the first generation to be raised with the current iteration of the internet and the rapid transfer of knowledge (this zoomers).

Point out the parts that they are doing well and encourage them to do that. Shame just says to the kid you did something poorly and should feel bad about trying. Constructive feedback is not shame but telling a kid that they can improve if they want by doing x, y, z.

Unless the things they're buying is limitless, buying any sort of goods and service makes them scarcer by definition. They buy cars? Now there's less cars available. They buy healthcare? Now there's less doctors/nurses available.

>you do realize you probably pay more in taxes than the Uber rich hoarders

Yeah because "hoarders" by definition describes how much savings one has. The tax system taxes income, not savings, so it's not surprising that a retired guy with no income but massive savings pays less taxes than a young professional earning 6 figures but little savings.

Then we moved into a cookie-cutter, older neighborhood without any kids my age. No trees to climb or creeks to search for frogs. Just plain, manicured grass lawns and being outside was no longer fun. Fortunately at that point I learned how to ride a bike so I could go to the other neighborhoods nearby.

I always wondered what it’d be like growing up in a big city. Seemed awful to me but thinking about it now, there’s still a lot of opportunities to explore.

It equates to less than 1% of the total child kidnapping cases. It may sound harsh, but I don't think even 1000 less kidnapping cases is equal to the extra obesity, gun deaths, accidental overdoses and mental health costs of today's society.

For example, a single extra kid being obese vs one less kid being kidnapped, obviously the kidnapping is more serious. But the reality is more like 30,000 extra kids become obese and 1 less kid gets kidnapped.

They had a lack of shame as a concept and sang baby shark on full blast with an expensive speaker next to other peoples classes.

I didn't understand there were people out there without an ulterior motive. Everything and everyone was transactional. It's weird because I certainly don't treat people that way (at least not purposely), yet I just assumed that's how everyone treated me, and I was fine with it. 


It really goes to show how that can possibly affect your decisions in relationships in the future. When transactional is the norm, and no strings attached, love is non-existent. I

Computers were ubiquitous in the workplace, with giant CTR monitors, but the Internet was extremely niche and then became interesting and new to the general public.

'Social media' was way, way, way into the future. We had Usenet, and it was for nerds.

DnD was socially embarassing. Or 'satanic'.

The policy on drugs was literally 'Just Say No'. 

Gay people existed. Margeret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were very angry about that. They also worked hard to disable social safety nets. Homelessness increased rapidly. 

A.I.D.S. was new, frightening and meant so many campaigns about condom use. Celebrities died. So, so many deaths.

And we were warned that global warming was *going* to be a thing and it was up to us (Gen X) to stop it when we got into power.    
Only we never really got into power and it's already happened. But we got told, a whole lot, to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

--->--->--->--->--->I think shame is a bad tool to use. Let’s use your example, physical violence isn’t a good resolution to express themselves. If a kid is shamed because they hit someone they might learn that they will be worth less than others because of their actions. They won’t directly learn that talking things through is a better resolution to conflict. Kids generally don’t think deeply about things  or make connections and correlations the same as an adult would. If they are shown positive examples they can learn directly what they need to. This is why teaching by example is so powerful.

Accidentally found that family this year through a DNA test, and it turns out nope, I was baby snatched and trafficked.  And this dude who I've always thought didn't give a damn about me, and who doesn't know me from a hole in the ground has been working like 110% to be a part of my life and prove that everything that's hurt my entire life was wrong.

A lost relative contacted my family as well after my Mom wanted to do one of the DNA tests. Her brother that died had a baby that he and none of us knew about. 

It was so crazy I thought it could be some weird scam. Because this was back when they lived in California. They moved to Oklahoma when my Grandfather retired from the Marines. The long lost relative was living 45 miles from us. She sounds and looks just like an aunt who died. It was pretty crazy to meet her. 

Would never think some stranger like that could become family instantly when you meet them. Like an episode of the Twilight Zone.

--->--->--->--->--->--->--->My dad was a shit dad, the only way he could have been worse would have to have been physically abusive. He didn’t even live that far but we didn’t know where. He never paid child support or even call or send birthday cards. He died in 2009 when I was 19 of cancer that he had known about for months and never bothered to tell us. So the last time I saw him was literally my sixth birthday then the next time was his funeral and in between, despite living only 2.5 hours drive away, we never even had a phone call (we lived in the same house the entire time). The real mindfuck was that he died with a picture of me and my sister next to his hospital bed from when we were tiny but he couldn’t be bothered to pick up a phone and call us to let us know he had cancer.

This also considering my dad’s therapy sessions have gotten him to the conclusion that some of his quirks are literally from being raised by someone who grew up during the great depression and could never change their habits afterwards which bled into their parenting style, which then subconsciously bled into him even though he never actually experienced it.

But to get to a real answer it’s probably not an “or” thing. The two issues above reinforce each other and now we have a generation of Smaugs. 

Not *all* are necessarily greedy dragons though. Like my dad is extremely generous but I pretty much have to force him to spend money on himself for trivial stuff like a 20 year old toaster that only toasts one side. It’s seriously like a mental disorder.
